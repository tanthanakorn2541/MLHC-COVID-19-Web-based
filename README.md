# COVID-19 CXR Classification Web Application v1.0

This web application is designed for classifying Chest X-Ray (CXR) images to identify potential cases of COVID-19. The application utilizes deep learning models trained on a dataset of CXR images to provide predictions with high accuracy.

## Features

- **Upload CXR Images:** Users can upload CXR images in standard formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG) to be classified.
- **Automatic Classification:** The uploaded images are automatically classified using the pre-trained deep learning models.
- **Display Results:** The application displays the classification results, including the probability of COVID-19 presence and any other relevant information.
- **Download Reports:** Users can download a detailed report containing the classification results and other metadata.
- **User Authentication:** Secure user authentication ensures that only authorized users can access the application.
